## Embedded game

Once you have a web build of your game (see instructions below), copy the build folder into:

`misc/game_build/`

Then this iframe will load it:

<iframe
  src="game_build/index.html"
  width="100%"
  height="720"
  style="border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>

## How to build the web version (using pygbag)

1. Install pygbag:
   - `python -m pip install pygbag`

2. Put your game in a folder with a `main.py` at the root.

3. Make your main loop *async-aware* (pygbag expects this). Then build:
   - `pygbag path/to/your/game_folder`

4. The output will include an `index.html` plus assets. Copy the output folder into `misc/game_build/`.

Tip: keep the game folder small - large assets can slow initial load.

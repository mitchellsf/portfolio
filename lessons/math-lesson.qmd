title: "Math lesson (demo)"
---

This is a starter lesson page. Quarto supports LaTeX-style math directly.

## Example: Taylor series

We can write inline math like $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ and displayed equations:

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}.
$$

## Example: A figure

Place images in `lessons/img/` and reference them like this:

![](img/example.png){fig-alt="Example static image" width="70%"}

## Notes
- If you generate images from Python/Matlab, export them as PNG/SVG and drop them into `lessons/img/`.
- You can also write lessons as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) if you want code+output.

title: "Mass-Spring-Damper System"
---

## Background

The mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is a simplified mathematical model of many real-world systems. @fig-msd-general-schematic shows the basic system considered. The objective is find the motion of the mass as a function of time. The mass is connected to the wall via a spring which provides a restoring force when stretched and a resisting force when compressed. This motion is opposed by a {{< ttip text="damper" title="A device which dissipates kinetic energy, usually via friction or fluid resistance." >}}, which is represented by wall friction in @fig-msd-general-schematic.

@fig-msd-moving-schematic shows the MSD system at three different states: when the mass is at rest $t<0$, the motion's initial conditions $t=0$, and once motion begins $t>0$.<br>
When the mass is at rest (in an equilibrium state), the spring is stretched by length $L$. It's convenient to define our coordinate system, $y$, based on position of the mass at its rest state so that displacement represents the distance from equilibrium.<br>
At  $t=0$, the mass is displaced by a distance $y_0$ with velocity $v_0$. This causes the mass to move for $t > 0$. Once in motion, we can have either an {{< ttip text="unforced system" title="Mass motion is purely due to initial displacement and velocity." >}} or a {{< ttip text="forced system" title="Mass motion is due to initial conditons plus external forces." >}} with the external force $f(t)$.

To gain an understanding of the real-world applications, we'll now consider four examples of MSD systems (shown in @fig-msd-examples along with a table summary @tbl-msd-examples):

- **Door closer** \- Opening the door loads a spring in the door closer mechanism, storing energy; when released, the spring drives the door shut while a hydraulic piston forces oil through a small orifice, providing damping that prevents the door from slamming.

- **Bike front suspension** \- A bump compresses the fork, increasing pressure in the air chamber (spring) that stores energy and pushes the fork back out, while a hydraulic damper controls oil flow to limit how quickly the fork compresses and rebounds so the bike doesn’t bounce.

- **Building** \- A building sways like a mass-spring-damper in wind or earthquakes, with the structure’s mass moving against the stiffness of columns/walls (spring) and energy lost through material/structural damping (damper). In extreme cases the wind forcing frequency can achieve resonance with the building's natural frequency, which can have catastrophic consequences. Some very tall buildings counter this with a {{< ttip text="tuned mass damper (TMD)" title="A type of MSD system which has the same natural frequency as the building but whose motion is out of phase with the building's." >}}.

- **RLC circuit** \- An RLC circuit is the electrical analog of a mass-spring-damper, where inductance acts like mass (inertia), capacitance like a spring (stored energy), and resistance like damping (energy dissipation).

## Governing Equation

To derive the governing equation for the mass's motion we first need to write the force balance via a free body diagram. @fig-msd-fbd shows the forces acting on the mass. For positive dispacement, $y>0$, the spring is stretched and gives a force in the negative $y$ direction. For negative displacement, the spring is compressed and gives a force in the positive $y$ direction. In both cases the spring force **opposes** the **displacement**, which may be written as $F_s = -ky$ where $k$ is the spring constant. Similarly, the damper **opposes** the **velocity** of the mass. This is just like surface friction opposing the motion of a block sliding or drag slowing a ball thrown through the air. This gives the force, $F_d = -c \dot{y}$, where a dot overhead represents taking a derivative with time. The linear relationship between force and velocity is an approximation, but accurate for most applications. Finally the external force, $f(t)$, is defined to be positive in the positive $y$ direction.

Next we apply Newton's second law of motion
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_y &= m a = m \ddot{y} \\
&= f - k y - c \dot{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

Rewriting gives the final governing equation
$$
m \ddot{y} + c \dot{y} + k y = f
$$ {#eq-gov-eq}
This equation is a second order, linear, nonhomogeneous, ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. Let's define each of these terms.

The **order** of an ODE is the highest order derivative derivative in the equation. In this case $\ddot{y}$ is the highest order derivative so we say the ODE is second order.

An ODE is **linear** if the coefficients of each $y$ term and its derivatives are only functions of the independent variable. e.g. $a(t)\dot{y}$ is linear but $y\dot{y}$ is non-linear.

A **homogeneous** ODE is linear but with no external forcing term. The external force, $f(t)$, in @eq-gov-eq makes the equation nonhomogeneous. This distinction has important implications in solution strategies.

An **ordinary** differential equation only has derivatives with respect to one independent variable; as opposed to a **partial** differential equation which has derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.

Each of these classifications has a significant influence on solution properties and strategies. Next we'll discuss the unforced system, $f(t) = 0$.

## The Unforced System

In the unforced system we set $f = 0$ in @eq-gov-eq and get
$$
m \ddot{y} + c \dot{y} + k y = 0
$$ {#eq-gov-eq-unforced}

title: "Mass-Spring-Damper System"
---

## Background

The mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is a simplified mathematical model of many real-world systems. @fig-msd-general-schematic shows the basic system considered. The objective is find the motion of the mass as a function of time. The mass is connected to the wall via a spring which provides a restoring force when stretched and a resisting force when compressed. This motion is opposed by a {{< ttip text="damper" title="A device which dissipates kinetic energy, usually via friction or fluid resistance." >}}, which is represented by wall friction in @fig-msd-general-schematic.

@fig-msd-moving-schematic shows the MSD system at three different states: when the mass is at rest $t<0$, the motion's initial conditions $t=0$, and once motion begins $t>0$.<br>
When the mass is at rest (in an equilibrium state), the spring is stretched by length $L$. It's convenient to define our coordinate system, $y$, based on position of the mass at its rest state so that displacement represents the distance from equilibrium.<br>
At  $t=0$, the mass is displaced by a distance $y_0$ with velocity $v_0$. This causes the mass to move for $t > 0$. Once in motion, we can have either an {{< ttip text="unforced system" title="Mass motion is purely due to initial displacement and velocity." >}} or a {{< ttip text="forced system" title="Mass motion is due to initial conditons plus external forces." >}} with the external force $f(t)$.

To gain an understanding of the real-world applications, we'll now consider four examples of MSD systems (shown in @fig-msd-examples along with a table summary @tbl-msd-examples):

- **Door closer** \- Opening the door loads a spring in the door closer mechanism, storing energy; when released, the spring drives the door shut while a hydraulic piston forces oil through a small orifice, providing damping that prevents the door from slamming.

- **Bike front suspension** \- A bump compresses the fork, increasing pressure in the air chamber (spring) that stores energy and pushes the fork back out, while a hydraulic damper controls oil flow to limit how quickly the fork compresses and rebounds so the bike doesn’t bounce.

- **Building** \- A building sways like a mass-spring-damper in wind or earthquakes, with the structure’s mass moving against the stiffness of columns/walls (spring) and energy lost through material/structural damping (damper). In extreme cases the wind forcing frequency can achieve resonance with the building's natural frequency, which can have catastrophic consequences. Some very tall buildings counter this with a {{< ttip text="tuned mass damper (TMD)" title="A type of MSD system which has the same natural frequency as the building but whose motion is out of phase with the building's. Because the motion is out of phase a TMD reduces the oscillation amplitude." >}}.

- **RLC circuit** \- An RLC circuit is the electrical analog of a mass-spring-damper, where inductance acts like mass (inertia), capacitance like a spring (stored energy), and resistance like damping (energy dissipation).

## Governing Equation

To derive the governing equation for the mass's motion we first need to write the force balance via a free body diagram. @fig-msd-fbd shows the forces acting on the mass. For positive dispacement, $y>0$, the spring is stretched and gives a force in the negative $y$ direction. For negative displacement, the spring is compressed and gives a force in the positive $y$ direction. In both cases the spring force **opposes** the **displacement**, which may be written as $F_s = -ky$ where $k$ is the spring constant. Similarly, the damper **opposes** the **velocity** of the mass. This is just like surface friction opposing the motion of a block sliding or drag slowing a ball thrown through the air. This gives the force, $F_d = -c \dot{y}$, where a dot overhead represents taking a derivative with time. The linear relationship between force and velocity is an approximation, but accurate for most applications. Finally the external force, $f(t)$, is defined to be positive in the positive $y$ direction.

Next we apply Newton's second law of motion
$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum F_y &= m a = m \ddot{y} \\
&= f - k y - c \dot{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

Rewriting gives the final governing equation
$$
m \ddot{y} + c \dot{y} + k y = f
$$ {#eq-gov-eq}
This equation is a second order, linear, nonhomogeneous, ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. Let's define each of these terms.

The **order** of an ODE is the highest order derivative derivative in the equation. In this case $\ddot{y}$ is the highest order derivative so we say the ODE is second order.

An ODE is **linear** if the coefficients of each $y$ term and its derivatives are only functions of the independent variable. e.g. $a(t)\dot{y}$ is linear but $y\dot{y}$ is non-linear.

A **homogeneous** ODE is linear but with no external forcing term. The external force, $f(t)$, in @eq-gov-eq makes the equation nonhomogeneous. This distinction has important implications in solution strategies. A principle feature of homogeneous ODEs is solutions can be {{< ttip text="superposed" title="Superposition means that we can obtain further solutions from given ones by adding them or multiplying them with constants. e.g. if y1 and y2 are solutions then so is y = c1*y1 + c2*y2 for any constant value of c1 and c2." >}}.

An **ordinary** differential equation only has derivatives with respect to one independent variable; as opposed to a **partial** differential equation which has derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.

Each of these classifications has a significant influence on solution properties and strategies. Next we'll discuss the unforced system, $f(t) = 0$.

## The Unforced System

### Analytical Solution

In the unforced system we set $f = 0$ in @eq-gov-eq and get
$$
m \ddot{y} + c \dot{y} + k y = 0
$$ {#eq-gov-eq-unforced}

This equation is now homogeneous, allowing us to apply the superposition principle to obtain the general solution.

In general, homogeneous ODEs with constant coeffients admit exponential solutions, i.e. solutions of the form $y(t) = a e^{\lambda t}$ where $\lambda$ is the growth/decay rate and can be {{< ttip text="complex" title="contains real and imaginary parts" >}}. For example, the first-order ODE $\dot{y}+by=0$ yields exponential decay $y = a e^{-bt}$ for $b>0$.

This suggests we should try to solve @eq-gov-eq-unforced assuming $y = a e^{\lambda t}$. Substituting in @eq-gov-eq-unforced yields
$$
a m \lambda^2 e^{\lambda t} + a c e^{\lambda t} + a k e^{\lambda t} = (m \lambda^2 + c \lambda + k)a e^{\lambda t} = 0
$$
which is reduced to
$$
m \lambda^2 + c \lambda + k = 0.
$$ {#eq-characteristic-eq}
@eq-characteristic-eq is known as the **characteristic equation**. This can be solved using the quadratic formula
$$
\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{1}{2m}\left( -c \pm \sqrt{c^2 - 4 m k} \right)
$$ {#eq-characteristic-sol}
where the subcript 1, 2 represents the fact there are two solutions to the characteristic equation corresponding to the '+' or '-' sign.

We've now solved the equation! We assumed $y = a e^{\lambda t}$ and found $\lambda$ must be @eq-characteristic-sol. Using the superposition principle, the general solution is then
$$
y = a_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} + a_2 e^{\lambda_2 t}
$$
The value of the constants $a_1$ and $a_2$ can be determined by the **initial conditons**, $y(0)=y_0$ and $\dot{y}(0) = v_0$. Since the ODE is second-order, we need two initial conditions.

Note in @eq-characteristic-sol that if $c^2 < 4mk$ then $\lambda$ is complex! This has important implications on the solution behavior and will be discussed next.

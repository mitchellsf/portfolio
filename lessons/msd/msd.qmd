title: "Mass-Spring-Damper System"
---

## Background

The mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is a simplified mathematical model of many real-world systems. There are a wide range of applications from the motion of a door swinging shut to how current travels through a circuit. The SMD system also draws on a variety of subjects such as differential equations, classical mechanics, numerical methods,  and control theory.

@fig-msd-general-schematic shows the basic system considered. The motion of the mass, $m$, as a function of time, $t$, is the objective of the problem. The mass is connected to the wall via a spring which provides a restoring force when stretched and a resisting force when compressed. The motion of the mass is opposed by a damper. The damper broadly represents the dissipation of kinetic energy, usually via friction or fluidic resistance. In @fig-msd-general-schematic the damper is the friction on the wall as the mass moves through a pipe.

@fig-msd-moving-schematic shows the MSD system at three different states: at rest $t<0$, the initial conditions $t=0$, and once motion begins $t>0$. When the mass is at rest (in an equilibrium state), the spring is stretched by length $L$. It's convenient to define our coordinate system, $y$, based on position of the mass at its rest state. At  $t=0$, the mass is displaced by a distance $y_0$ with velocity $v_0$. This causes the mass to move for $t > 0$.

So far we have only considered an {{< ttip text="unforced system" title="Mass motion is purely due to initial displacement and velocity." >}}, however generally we can consider a {{< ttip text="forced system" title="Mass motion is due to initial conditons plus external forces." >}}. For a forced system, there is an external force, $f(t)$ acting on the mass as it is set in motion. Figure @fig-msd-forced-schematic shows the forced MSD system.

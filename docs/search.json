    "section": "Governing Equation",
    "text": "Governing Equation\nTo derive the governing equation for the mass’s motion we first need to write the force balance via a free body diagram. Figure 4 shows the forces acting on the mass. For positive dispacement, y&gt;0, the spring is stretched and gives a force in the negative y direction. For negative displacement, the spring is compressed and gives a force in the positive y direction. In both cases the spring force opposes the displacement, which may be written as F_s = -ky where k is the spring constant. Similarly, the damper opposes the velocity of the mass. This is just like surface friction opposing the motion of a block sliding or drag slowing a ball thrown through the air. This gives the force, F_d = -c \\dot{y}, where a dot overhead represents taking a derivative with time. The linear relationship between force and velocity is an approximation, but accurate for most applications. Finally the external force, f(t), is defined to be positive in the positive y direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: MSD Free Body Diagram\n\n\n\n\nNext we apply Newton’s second law of motion \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum F_y &= m a = m \\ddot{y} \\\\\n&= f - k y - c \\dot{y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\nRewriting gives the final governing equation \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = f\n\\tag{1} This equation is a second order, linear, nonhomogeneous, ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients. Let’s define each of these terms.\nThe order of an ODE is the highest order derivative derivative in the equation. In this case \\ddot{y} is the highest order derivative so we say the ODE is second order.\nAn ODE is linear if the coefficients of each y term and its derivatives are only functions of the independent variable. e.g. a(t)\\dot{y} is linear but y\\dot{y} is non-linear.\nA homogeneous ODE is linear but with no external forcing term. The external force, f(t), in Equation 1 makes the equation nonhomogeneous. This distinction has important implications in solution strategies. A principle feature of homogeneous ODEs is solutions can be superposed.\nAn ordinary differential equation only has derivatives with respect to one independent variable; as opposed to a partial differential equation which has derivatives with respect to two or more independent variables.\nEach of these classifications has a significant influence on solution properties and strategies. Next we’ll discuss the unforced system, f(t) = 0."

    "text": "The Unforced System\nIn the unforced system we set f = 0 in Equation 1 and get \nm \\ddot{y} + c \\dot{y} + k y = 0\n\\tag{2}\nThis equation is now homogeneous, allowing us to apply the superposition principle to obtain the general solution.\nIn general, homogeneous ODEs with constant coeffients admit exponential solutions, i.e. solutions of the form y(t) = a e^{\\lambda t} where \\lambda is the growth/decay rate and can be complex. For example, the first-order ODE \\dot{y}+by=0 yields exponential decay y = a e^{-bt} for b&gt;0.\nThis suggests we should try to solve Equation 2 assuming y = a e^{\\lambda t}. Substituting in Equation 2 yields \na m \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda t} + a c e^{\\lambda t} + a k e^{\\lambda t} = (m \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k)a e^{\\lambda t} = 0\n which is reduced to \nm \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + k = 0.\n\\tag{3} Equation 3 is known as the characteristic equation. This can be solved using the quadratic formula \n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left( -c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4 m k} \\right)\n\\tag{4} where the subcript 1, 2 represents the fact there are two solutions to the characteristic equation corresponding to the ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign.\nWe’ve now solved the equation! We assumed y = a e^{\\lambda t} and found \\lambda must be Equation 4. Using the superposition principle, the general solution is then \ny = a_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t} + a_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t}\n The value of the constants a_1 and a_2 can be determined by the initial conditons, y(0)=y_0 and \\dot{y}(0) = v_0. Since the ODE is second-order, we need two initial conditions.\n\n\nEffect of Damping"

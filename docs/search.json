    "text": "The mass-spring-damper (MSD) system is a simplified mathematical model of many real-world systems. There are a wide range of applications from the motion of a door swinging shut to how current travels through a circuit. The SMD system also draws on a variety of subjects such as differential equations, classical mechanics, numerical methods, and control theory.\nFigure 1 shows the basic system considered. The motion of the mass, \\(m\\), as a function of time, \\(t\\), is the objective of the problem. The mass is connected to the wall via a spring which provides a restoring force when stretched and a resisting force when compressed. The motion of the mass is opposed by a damper. The damper broadly represents the dissipation of kinetic energy, usually via friction or fluidic resistance. In Figure 1 the damper is the friction on the wall as the mass moves through a pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: MSD General Schematic\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows the MSD system at three different states: at rest \\(t&lt;0\\), the initial conditions \\(t=0\\), and once motion begins \\(t&gt;0\\). When the mass is at rest (in an equilibrium state), the spring is stretched by length \\(L\\). It’s convenient to define our coordinate system, \\(y\\), based on position of the mass at its rest state. At \\(t=0\\), the mass is displaced by a distance \\(y_0\\) with velocity \\(v_0\\).
